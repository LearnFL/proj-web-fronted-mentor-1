## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JQuery

### What I learned

I learned to keep it "simple". I implemented the first dropdown menu using CSS, the other one using JQuery for fun. This added complexity.
Later I commented out JQuery implementation and added CSS for the second dropdown menu so they have uniform look.
I wanted to keep JavaScript to minimum, avoided CSS grid and Bootstrap on purpose.

### Continued development

There is plenty to learn and get better in.
